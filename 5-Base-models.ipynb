    "- Despite some initial promise, the finetuned modelâ€™s performance is disappointing. \n",
    "- It occasionally shows improved formatting with no unnecessary text, just code, like from the way the model was finetuned and it mimics Python syntax more cleanly with typehints than the base model, its actual logic is obviously broken most times or completely incoherent. \n",
    "- In many cases, it fails to solve even basic problems correctly, restates the prompt instead of generating code, or outputs nonsense wrapped in proper function signatures. \n",
    "- The base model is actually better, and gets a lot right. The Leetcode FineTuning actually performed wose. \n",
    "- Finetuning made it sound smarter without actually making it smarter, and the handful of successful generations are discounted by the other completely incoherrent outputss.\n",
    "- While calculating BLEU scores, the predictions actually were a lot better - i associate that to the quality of the prompts. That is because the prompts were exactly in the format it was finetuned on, and i did not notice any issues with the prompts ghosting into the output, or repeating inputs."
